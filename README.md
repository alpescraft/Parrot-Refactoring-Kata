## Parrot Refactoring Kata

Can you spot any code smells in this code? I'll give you a clue - a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!

Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful you can make it.


## How to start the challenge

Clone the repo, checkout the branch `push-challenge`, and create your own branch from it.
> git clone git@github.com:alpescraft/Parrot-Refactoring-Kata.git

### Acknowledgements

This code is heavily inspired by one of the examples in Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring". It's a classic, and if it's not on your bookshelf already I suggest you treat yourself to a copy!
